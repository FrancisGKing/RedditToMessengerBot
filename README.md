This is a bot that receives messages on Facebook messenger and returns a post from pre-defined subreddits. This project was created to practice using a python web server, Heroku, Facebook's developer tools, and PRAW, the reddit API. I created this project by following [this tutorial from Python Tips](https://pythontips.com/2017/04/13/making-a-reddit-facebook-messenger-bot/).

TODO
- Expand functionality to allow for any subreddit to be called
- Make README more thorough
